What is generative AI?

Generative artificial intelligence, also known as generative AI or simply gen AI, is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. It can learn human language, programming languages, art, chemistry, biology, or any complex subject. It reuses what it knows to solve new problems.

For example, it can learn English vocabulary and create a poem from the words it processes.

Your organization can use generative AI for a variety of purposes, including chatbots, media creation, and product development and design.
